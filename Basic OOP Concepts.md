## 1. Classes and Objects

>	A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behavior of an object. An Object is an instances of a class, created using the class definition.

Here's an example of a class definition in Python:

![
class Car:
  def __init__(self, make, model, year):
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year
  def start_engine(self):
    print (f"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine is starting.")](example-class.png)
